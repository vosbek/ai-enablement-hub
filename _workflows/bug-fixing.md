# AI-Powered Bug Investigation & Fix Workflow

**Purpose**: Systematically investigate, understand, and fix bugs using AI assistance for root cause analysis and solution generation.

## üìã Prerequisites

- [ ] Bug report with reproduction steps
- [ ] Access to logs and error messages
- [ ] Development environment ready
- [ ] VS Code with Enterprise Copilot Coach installed

## üîç Workflow Steps

Analyze this bug report and provide investigation strategy:

**Bug Description:**
[PASTE BUG DESCRIPTION]

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

**Expected Behavior:**
[What should happen]

**Actual Behavior:**
[What actually happens]

**Error Messages/Logs:**
[PASTE ERROR LOGS]

**Environment:**
- OS: [Operating System]
- Browser/Runtime: [Version]
- Application Version: [Version]

Please provide:
1. **Root cause hypotheses** - Most likely causes ranked by probability
2. **Investigation approach** - Step-by-step debugging strategy
3. **Code areas to examine** - Specific files/functions to check
4. **Additional information needed** - What else to gather
5. **Risk assessment** - Impact and urgency evaluation
```

#### Step 2: Reproduce the Issue
- [ ] Follow reproduction steps exactly
- [ ] Document any variations or additional symptoms
- [ ] Capture screenshots/logs of the actual behavior
- [ ] Test in different environments if possible

**AI Assistant Action**:
```bash
# If you can't reproduce
Use "Troubleshooting" prompt with your environment details
```

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis (10-15 minutes)

#### Step 3: Code Investigation
```
Use Prompt: "Code Investigation"

Help me investigate this bug in the codebase:

**Bug Summary:** [Brief description]
**Error/Symptom:** [What's going wrong]

**Suspected Code Area:**
```[language]
[PASTE RELEVANT CODE SECTION]
```

**Context:** [How this code fits into the larger system]

Please analyze:
1. **Logic errors** - Incorrect algorithms or conditions
2. **State management issues** - Variable/object state problems
3. **Async/timing problems** - Race conditions, callback issues
4. **Input validation gaps** - Missing checks or sanitization
5. **Integration issues** - Problems with external systems
6. **Resource management** - Memory leaks, connection issues

Provide specific line-by-line analysis and suggest investigation steps.
```

#### Step 4: Analyze Dependencies & Data Flow
```
Use Prompt: "Data Flow Analysis"

Trace the data flow for this bug scenario:

**Function/Method:** [Entry point]
**Input Data:** [What data is being processed]
**Expected Flow:** [How data should move through the system]

**Code to analyze:**
```[language]
[PASTE CODE PATH]
```

Map out:
1. **Data transformation points** - Where data changes
2. **Validation checkpoints** - Where validation occurs (or should)
3. **Error handling points** - Where errors are caught/handled
4. **Side effects** - Database updates, API calls, etc.
5. **State mutations** - Where application state changes

Identify where the flow might be breaking down.
```

### Phase 3: Solution Development (5-10 minutes)

#### Step 5: Generate Fix Options
```
Use Prompt: "Bug Fix Generator"

Generate fix options for this bug:

**Root Cause:** [What you've identified as the main issue]
**Affected Code:**
```[language]
[PASTE PROBLEMATIC CODE]
```

**Context:** [Surrounding system details]

Provide multiple fix approaches:
1. **Quick fix** - Minimal change to resolve immediate issue
2. **Robust fix** - More comprehensive solution
3. **Preventive fix** - Includes measures to prevent similar bugs

For each approach, include:
- Code changes needed
- Potential side effects
- Testing requirements
- Risk assessment
- Long-term implications
```

#### Step 6: Implement & Test Fix
1. **Apply the chosen fix**
2. **Test the specific bug scenario**
3. **Run related tests**
4. **Check for regressions**

**AI Assistant Action**:
```bash
# Generate tests for your fix
Use "Test Generation" prompt with your fixed code
```

### Phase 4: Validation & Prevention (5-10 minutes)

#### Step 7: Comprehensive Testing
```
Use Prompt: "Bug Fix Validation"

Generate comprehensive tests for this bug fix:

**Original Bug:** [Description]
**Fix Applied:**
```[language]
[PASTE YOUR FIX]
```

Generate tests for:
1. **Bug reproduction test** - Verify the original bug is fixed
2. **Edge cases** - Similar scenarios that might break
3. **Regression tests** - Ensure existing functionality still works
4. **Integration tests** - Verify system-wide compatibility
5. **Performance tests** - Check if fix impacts performance

Include specific test data and assertions.
```

#### Step 8: Code Review & Documentation
```
Use Prompt: "Bug Fix Review"

Review this bug fix for quality and completeness:

**Original Code:**
```[language]
[PASTE ORIGINAL CODE]
```

**Fixed Code:**
```[language]
[PASTE FIXED CODE]
```

**Bug Context:** [Description of what was wrong]

Evaluate:
1. **Fix correctness** - Does it actually solve the problem?
2. **Code quality** - Is the solution clean and maintainable?
3. **Error handling** - Are edge cases properly handled?
4. **Performance impact** - Any negative effects on performance?
5. **Documentation needs** - What should be documented?
6. **Prevention measures** - How to avoid similar bugs?
```
