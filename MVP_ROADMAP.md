## üéØ Custom Prompts for Your Codebase

### 1. üèóÔ∏è Planning: Design New Claims Feature
**When to use**: Starting any new claims-related feature
**Context**: Based on your claims domain models and API patterns

```
Design a new feature for our insurance claims API:

Feature Requirements: [DESCRIBE YOUR FEATURE]

Our Current Claims Architecture:
- Claims Model: See src/models/Claim.ts - we use status workflow (submitted ‚Üí under_review ‚Üí approved/denied)
- API Pattern: RESTful endpoints in src/routes/claims.js following our middleware chain
- Business Rules: Complex validation in src/services/ClaimsService.ts
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma, using our audit trail pattern

Example Claim Flow (from your codebase):
POST /api/claims ‚Üí ClaimValidationMiddleware ‚Üí ClaimsController.create ‚Üí ClaimsService.processNewClaim

Real Example from your code:
[Actual code snippet from src/controllers/ClaimsController.ts]

Please design:
1. **API endpoints** - Following our RESTful pattern
2. **Database schema** - Prisma migrations needed
3. **Business logic** - Service layer implementation
4. **Validation rules** - Using our Joi patterns
5. **Test scenarios** - Coverage for claims workflows
```

### 2. ‚ö° Implementation: Add Claims API Endpoint
**When to use**: Creating new claims-related endpoints
**Context**: Follows your Express + Prisma patterns

```
Implement a new claims API endpoint following our established patterns:

Endpoint Requirements: [YOUR REQUIREMENTS]

Our Express.js Patterns (from your actual code):
- Route Structure: src/routes/[resource].js with express.Router()
- Middleware Chain: authMiddleware ‚Üí validateSchema ‚Üí controller ‚Üí errorHandler
- Response Format: { success: boolean, data: ClaimDTO, metadata?: object }
- Error Handling: Custom AppError classes (see src/utils/errors/)

Your Typical Controller Pattern:
[Actual code from src/controllers/ClaimsController.ts showing your patterns]

Your Service Layer Pattern:
[Actual code from src/services/ClaimsService.ts showing business logic]

Your Database Pattern:
[Actual Prisma usage from your codebase]

Please implement:
1. **Route definition** - In src/routes/claims.js following our pattern
2. **Controller method** - Business logic orchestration
3. **Service layer** - Core business rules
4. **Validation schema** - Joi schema for request validation
5. **Error handling** - Using our AppError patterns
6. **Unit tests** - Following our Jest + Supertest patterns in tests/
```

### 3. üß™ Testing: Test Claims Processing Logic
**When to use**: Adding tests for claims functionality
**Context**: Your Jest + Supertest testing patterns

```
Write comprehensive tests for claims processing logic:

Code to Test: [YOUR CLAIMS CODE]

Our Testing Patterns (from your actual tests):
- Test Structure: describe/it blocks with clear test names
- Setup/Teardown: beforeEach for database seeding (see tests/setup.js)
- Mocking: Mock external services like payment gateway (see tests/mocks/)
- Assertions: Expect patterns for success/error cases

Your Actual Test Example:
[Real test from tests/claims/ClaimsController.test.js]

Your Database Test Pattern:
[How you handle test data in tests/fixtures/]

Your Mock Patterns:
[How you mock external services from tests/mocks/]

Please create:
1. **Unit tests** - Test individual functions in isolation
2. **Integration tests** - Test full request/response cycles
3. **Database tests** - Test Prisma operations and constraints
4. **Mock setup** - For external payment/notification services
5. **Edge cases** - Invalid claims, boundary conditions, error scenarios
```

### 4. üîç Code Review: Review Claims Implementation
**When to use**: Before merging claims-related code
**Context**: Your code quality standards and patterns

```
Review this claims-related code for our insurance API:

Code to Review:
```
[YOUR CODE HERE]
```

Our Code Quality Standards (based on your codebase):
- TypeScript: Strict typing, proper interfaces (see src/types/)
- Error Handling: Consistent AppError usage and proper async/await
- Database: Proper Prisma usage with transactions for critical operations
- Security: Input validation, SQL injection prevention, audit logging
- Performance: Efficient queries, proper indexing considerations

Patterns in Our Codebase:
- Claims Processing: Follow the state machine pattern (see ClaimsService.ts)
- Audit Trail: Every claim change must be logged (see AuditService.ts)
- Validation: Use Joi schemas consistently (see src/validation/)
- Documentation: JSDoc for public methods (see existing patterns)

Please review for:
1. **Code Quality** - TypeScript usage, error handling, async patterns
2. **Security** - Input validation, authorization, data sanitization
3. **Performance** - Query optimization, N+1 problems, caching opportunities
4. **Maintainability** - Code organization, naming, documentation
5. **Testing** - Adequate test coverage for critical paths
6. **Business Logic** - Follows our claims workflow requirements
```

### 5. üöÄ Deployment: Deploy Claims Feature
**When to use**: Deploying claims-related changes
**Context**: Your deployment pipeline and infrastructure

```
Deploy the new claims feature following our deployment process:

Changes to Deploy: [DESCRIBE YOUR CHANGES]

Our Deployment Context:
- Infrastructure: AWS ECS with Docker containers

## üéØ Next Steps for You

I recommend starting with:

1. **Build the CLI MVP** first (simplest to validate concept)
2. **Create the VS Code extension** (where the real value is)
3. **Add enterprise aggregation** (scale across your organization)

Would you like me to start building the CLI tool or VS Code extension? I can create the actual working code for either approach!
