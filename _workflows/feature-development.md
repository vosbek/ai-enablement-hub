# AI-Assisted Feature Development Workflow

**Purpose**: Complete end-to-end feature development using AI assistance for code generation, review, testing, and documentation.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [ ] Feature requirements defined
- [ ] VS Code with Enterprise Copilot Coach installed
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] Development environment set up

## 🚀 Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Planning & Architecture (10-15 minutes)

#### Step 1: Analyze Requirements
```
Use Prompt: "Architecture Planning"

Analyze these feature requirements and suggest:
1. **Architecture approach** - Components, modules, data flow
2. **File structure** - Where to place new files
3. **Dependencies** - External libraries needed
4. **Integration points** - How it connects to existing code
5. **Potential challenges** - Risk areas and mitigation

**Requirements:**

**Existing codebase context:**
[DESCRIBE CURRENT ARCHITECTURE]
```

#### Step 2: Create Development Checklist
- [ ] Break down feature into subtasks
- [ ] Identify API endpoints needed
- [ ] Plan database schema changes
- [ ] Design component hierarchy (if frontend)
- [ ] List test scenarios

**AI Assistant Action**: 
```bash
# Generate task breakdown
Use "Task Breakdown" prompt on your feature requirements
```

### Phase 2: Implementation (25-35 minutes)

#### Step 3: Generate Core Logic
```
Use Prompt: "Code Generation"

Generate the core implementation for this feature:

**Feature:** [Feature name and description]
**Language/Framework:** [Your tech stack]
**Requirements:**
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

**Context:** [Existing code patterns to follow]

Please provide:
- Complete implementation with error handling
- Integration with existing codebase
- Input validation and security considerations
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive commenting
```

#### Step 4: Implement Step-by-Step
1. **Create base files/classes**
   ```bash
   # Use AI to generate boilerplate
   Select template code → Right-click → "AI Assistant" → "Generate Implementation"
   ```

2. **Implement core functionality**
   - Use code completion for method implementations
   - Apply "Code Review" prompt after each major function
   - Refactor using "Intelligent Refactoring" prompt

3. **Add error handling**
   ```
   Use Prompt: "Error Handling"
   
   Add comprehensive error handling to this code:
   [PASTE YOUR CODE]
   
   Include:
   - Input validation
   - Exception handling
   - Logging
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Graceful degradation
   ```

#### Step 5: Integration & Testing
```
Use Prompt: "Integration Testing"

Generate integration tests for this feature:
[PASTE YOUR IMPLEMENTATION]

Include tests for:
- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Integration with existing systems
- Performance under load
- Security vulnerabilities
```

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (10-15 minutes)

#### Step 6: Code Review
```
Use Prompt: "Code Review Assistant"

[PASTE COMPLETE FEATURE CODE]

Focus on:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance optimizations
- Code maintainability
- Best practices compliance
- Integration issues
```

#### Step 7: Generate Tests
```
Use Prompt: "Smart Test Generator"

[PASTE YOUR FEATURE CODE]

Generate:
- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Performance benchmarks
- Security tests
```

#### Step 8: Documentation
```
Use Prompt: "Smart Documentation Generator"

Generate documentation for this feature:
[PASTE YOUR CODE]

Include:
- Feature overview and purpose
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Configuration options
- Troubleshooting guide
```
